<AlverManager.py> is a Python script for a "DAG-based" blockchain that manages AIadapters. Each aladapter is represented as a node in the DAG. The DAG maintains dependencies between AIadapter versions, along with metadata like identity name, lifetime, expiration date, policy files, and regulations.

Key Features
1.    AIadapter Metadata:
        - Identity Name: Unique name of the algorithm.
        - Version: Version number of the algorithm.
        - Lifetime: Duration of the algorithmâ€™s validity.
        - Expiration Date: Expiration date of the algorithm.
        - Policy File: Shared policy file name.
        - Regulations: Rules and policies governing the algorithm.
2.    DAG Structure:
       - Nodes represent individual algorithm versions.
       - Each node can reference one or more parent nodes, ensuring dependency tracking.
3.    Validation:
       - Ensures the graph is acyclic.
       - Verifies parent dependencies exist before adding new nodes.
4.    Extensibility:
      - New metadata fields can be added to Aladapter as needed.
      - DAG structure can be used for advanced dependency analysis.
