<AlverManager.py> in the SingleChainBlockchain foler is a Python script for a "single-chain" blockchain tailored to manage versions of algorithms, including their identity names, lifetimes, expiration dates, a shared policy file, and associated regulations.

Key Features
1.    Algorithm Structure: 
        Each algorithm stores:
        - Identity name
        - Version
        - Lifetime
        - Expiration date
        - Policy file
        - Associated regulations
2.    Blockchain Structure:
        - Stores multiple algorithms per block.
        - Links blocks cryptographically.
        - Mining and Validation:
        - Proof-of-work ensures immutability.
        - Validates the chain by verifying hashes.
3.    Customizable:
        - The difficulty level can be adjusted.
        - Add policies and regulations as per need.

Running the Code
1.    Save the code into a Python file, e.g., algorithm_blockchain.py.
2.    Run it using Python: python algorithm_blockchain.py.
3.    Experiment with adding new algorithms and viewing the blockchainâ€™s state.
