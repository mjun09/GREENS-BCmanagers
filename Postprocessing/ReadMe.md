<Postprocessing.py> is a Python script for post-processing AI training and output datasets, applying anomaly detection. Weâ€™ll use the scikit-learn library for simplicity, leveraging Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.

Steps:
    1. Data Loading:
        - Loads the training and output datasets using Pandas.
        - Replace training_data.csv and output_data.csv with your actual dataset paths.
    2. Data Preprocessing:
        - Standardizes the data using StandardScaler for better performance in anomaly detection.
    3. Anomaly Detection:
        - Applies Isolation Forest to detect anomalies.
        - The contamination parameter specifies the expected proportion of anomalies.
    4. Post-Processing:
        - Adds an Anomaly column to the dataset (1 for normal, -1 for anomalies).
        - Filters out the anomalous data points for analysis.
    5. Result Saving:
        - Saves the anomalous records from the training and output datasets for further investigation.

Execution
    1. Save the training and output datasets as CSV files.
    2. Replace the file paths in training_path and output_path.
    3. Run the script.

Example Output:
    - Number of anomalies detected in training data.
    - Number of anomalies detected in output data.
    - Anomalous records saved to training_anomalies.csv and output_anomalies.csv.
