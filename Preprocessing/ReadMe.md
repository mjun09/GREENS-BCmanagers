<Preprocessing.py> is a python script for a preprocessing pipeline that performs filtering, sampling, quantization, feature extraction, and encoding in order.This is a generic implementation and can be tailored based on the specific dataset a requirements. For simplicity, I will use NumPy and Scikit-learn libraries.

Steps:
    1.    Filter:
            - The butter_lowpass_filter applies a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noise.
    2.    Sampler:
            - The downsample function reduces the number of samples by keeping every nth sample.
    3.    Quantizer:
            - The quantize function converts the continuous data into discrete levels.
    4.    Feature Extraction:
            - The extract_features function calculates statistical features (e.g., mean, standard deviation).
    5.    Encoding:
            - The one_hot_encode function converts discrete feature values into a one-hot encoded representation.
