<blockchain.py> is a python script of a blockchain that allows storing a large amount of data as transactions. Each block contains multiple transactions, and the blockchain validates and stores the blocks in a linked manner using cryptographic hashes.

Key Features:
1.    Transactions: Each transaction stores sender, recipient, and data.
2.    Blocks: Each block includes a list of transactions, a timestamp, and links to the previous block using a hash.
3.    Mining: Simple proof-of-work mechanism using a difficulty level.
4.    Validation: Ensures the chainâ€™s integrity by checking hashes.

How to Run:
1.    Save the code into a Python file, e.g., blockchain.py.
2.    Run it using Python: python blockchain.py.
3.    Add more transactions, adjust the difficulty, or experiment with the mining process.
